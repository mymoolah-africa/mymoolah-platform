## ðŸ“‹ **INTEGRATION GUIDELINES**

### **Step 1: Keep Your Excellent Foundation**
- âœ… Keep current App.tsx (perfect routing)
- âœ… Keep current globals.css (perfect Tailwind v4 + MyMoolah)
- âœ… Keep current contexts (perfect authentication)
- âœ… Keep current package.json (proper dependencies)

### **Step 2: Identify Beneficial Figma Components**
Look for these in your Figma files:
- New page designs that enhance your current pages
- New UI components not in your shadcn library
- Enhanced styling for specific features
- New icons or assets

### **Step 3: Selective Addition Process**
For each beneficial component:
1. Compare with your current version
2. If Figma version is better, enhance your current file (don't replace)
3. If it's a new component, add it to appropriate folder
4. Test after each addition

### **Step 4: Integration Commands**
```bash
# Only add specific beneficial files:
cp temp_figma_analysis/components/NewComponent.tsx frontend/components/
cp temp_figma_analysis/assets/new-icon.svg frontend/assets/

# Test after each addition:
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

## ðŸŽ¨ **LOGO SYSTEM INTEGRATION**

### **Current Logo Implementation**
- **LoginPage**: Uses `logo3.svg` with error handling
- **RegisterPage**: Uses `logo2.svg` at 60% larger size
- **Fallback**: "M" logo when SVG fails to load
- **Paths**: `/assets/logo2.svg` and `/assets/logo3.svg`

### **Integration Best Practices**
- Always test logo loading after changes
- Maintain fallback system for reliability
- Keep consistent sizing across pages
- Preserve Figma design fidelity
