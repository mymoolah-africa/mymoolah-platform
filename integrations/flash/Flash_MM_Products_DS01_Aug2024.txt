Dear Partner, 
 
RE: COMMERCIALS ON SELECTED VALUE-ADDED SERVICES  
 
Flash Mobile Vending (“Flash”) holds the necessary agreements and relationships with various Service Providers 
to aggregate their  value-added services. Should  you  agree  to  the  terms  hereof, Flash will  manage  all Service 
Provider relationships and offer one consolidated support structure and you will therefore only need to manage 
one integration/relationship.   
 
Please note all commercials rates are inclusive of VAT at 15%. 
 
In the absence of specific payment terms as set out in the table below or as advised by Flash from time to time, 
the following will apply:  
 
We will require that you make daily payments for the previous days transactions. Flash will invoice for the 
face value (ex VAT) once a month. The Partner invoices for commission (incl VAT) for the month. Flash 
to pay 7 days from invoice. All services without listed payment terms will require COD payments and/or 
deposits.  
 
Any fixed amount commission/discount rates as specified below will be reviewed every 6 months and the 
parties will negotiate in good faith such adjustment as may be required from time to time. 
  
Any  commission/discount  will  be  adjusted  automatically  in  the  event  of  a decrease in  the  commission 
rates that may be charged by Flash to the relevant Service Provider for collecting payments on its behalf. 
The  percentage  change  applied  to  the  commissions/discounts  in  such  event  will  be  equivalent  to  the 
percentage change applied by the Service Provider to the Flash Commission. Flash will notify the Partner 
in writing upon the occurrence of any such change specifying the date on which such change is to take 
effect.
