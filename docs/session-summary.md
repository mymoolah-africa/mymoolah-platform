# Session Summary

## [2024-07-12] Wallet-First, Closed-Loop, and Mojaloop-First Strategy
- MyMoolah's urgent business requirement: launch its own wallet for individuals, and provide REST API integration for closed-loop clients (with millions of wallets/accounts) and service providers (VAS, payments) using pre-funded ledger accounts.
- All new features and integrations must use Mojaloop APIs and best practices, even for closed-loop (internal/partner) flows, to ensure future-proofing, compliance, and interoperability.
- The platform is architected as a dual-rail (closed-loop + Mojaloop) solution, with a "Mojaloop-first" policy for all transaction flows.
- Documentation updated across all key files to reflect this strategy and session decisions.

## [2025-06-27] Major API Expansion & Documentation Rule

- Implemented and tested all wallet, voucher, KYC, notifications, and support endpoints.
- Committed and pushed after every major step.
- All endpoints are working and returning correct data.
- Documentation rule: All documentation is written, updated, and maintained by the developer/agent, not the product owner, as per project rules.
- Ready to proceed with authentication, VAS, and admin endpoints.

## Implemented API Endpoints (as of June 2025)
- **User**: POST /api/v1/users/register
- **Client**: GET /api/v1/clients
- **Wallet**: POST /api/v1/wallets, GET /api/v1/wallets/:id, GET /api/v1/wallets/:id/balance, POST /api/v1/wallets/:id/credit, POST /api/v1/wallets/:id/debit, GET /api/v1/wallets/:id/transactions
- **Voucher**: POST /api/v1/vouchers/issue, POST /api/v1/vouchers/redeem, GET /api/v1/vouchers
- **KYC**: POST /api/v1/kyc/upload, GET /api/v1/kyc/:user_id

- **Support**: POST /api/v1/support, GET /api/v1/support/:user_id

**Documentation Rule:**  
All documentation must be written, updated, and maintained by the developer/agentâ€”not the product owner. The agent is responsible for updating all docs, committing, and pushing to GitHub after every major change or session. The product owner should only review, approve, or request changes, not manually edit documentation files.
[2024-07-12] Cleanup & Verification Session
Created a backup branch (cleanup-backup) before making any changes.
Removed unnecessary dependencies (e.g., mongoose) and files (.DS_Store, .viminfo, server_js.code-search, .mariadb_history).
Installed and verified all required dependencies (express, mysql2, dotenv, cors).
Restarted the server and confirmed all endpoints (e.g., /api/v1/clients) are working.
Committed and pushed all changes to the cleanup-backup branch on GitHub.
Confirmed project is MySQL-only, clean, and up to Mojaloop-aligned standards.
Ready for further development, testing, or merging into main.

## [2024-07-13] Client Float Account Clarification
- For B2B clients (e.g., betting operators), MyMoolah only tracks and manages the main prefunded float account for each client. The client is responsible for tracking and managing their own sub-wallets/customers; MyMoolah does not track or manage these sub-wallets.
