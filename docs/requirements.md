## Project Overview
MyMoolah is a cloud-native, Mojaloop-inspired banking and wallet platform for Africa, designed for cost efficiency, scalability, and compliance with international banking standards.

---

## Business & Technical Goals

- Serve B2B clients and enable them to manage prefunded float accounts for millions of end users.
- Support low-income individuals in Africa with affordable, accessible digital financial services.
- Integrate with multiple VAS and payment service providers (e.g., DT Mercury for PayShap, Mobilemart, Flash).
- Provide a secure, auditable, and compliant platform for all transactions.
- Modular Node.js/Express backend with MySQL (Google Cloud SQL).
- RESTful API, documented with OpenAPI/Swagger.
- KYC onboarding for B2B and B2C (document upload, approval workflow).
- Voucher system for secure generation, distribution, and redemption.
- Real-time transaction processing (1000+ TPS target).
- Scalable, cloud-native deployment (Google Cloud, Codespaces for dev).
- Security: PCI DSS compliance, OAuth2/JWT, encryption, audit logging.

## Account Types & Requirements

### Client Accounts (B2B)
- Onboarding, KYC, compliance.
- Float account management (ZAR, multi-currency future).

- Each client can have millions of customers, each with an internal wallet managed by the client.
- Compliance, security, auditability.

### Service Provider Accounts
- Modular API integration (e.g., DT Mercury for PayShap, Mobilemart, Flash).
- Float management, notifications, KYC, compliance.
- Transaction journey, pricing/on-selling, reporting, VAT handling, security, audit.

### User Accounts (B2C)
- KYC (SA ID or passport), document upload, proof of address.
- Funding via EFT, PayShap, vouchers.
- Voucher system, transaction history, reporting.
- Mobile number as account number, unique backend ID.
- Security, simplicity.

### Internal/Operational Accounts
- System float, fee collection, VAT holding, suspense/settlement.
- Full transaction history, audit trail, reconciliation, segregation of funds.

### Agent/Merchant/API Accounts (Future)

## API & Data Model

- **Implemented Endpoints:**
  - `POST /api/v1/users/register` (user registration, validation, hashing, duplicate check)
- **Planned Endpoints:**
  - Wallet funding, transaction history, voucher management, KYC upload, authentication, VAS integrations, notifications, support tickets.
- **Data Model:**
  - Robust ERD with tables for clients, users, wallets, transactions, vouchers, KYC, VAT, audit logs, notifications, support tickets.

---

## Backend Implementation Status (as of July 2024)

- User registration API (`/api/v1/users/register`) is implemented with validation, password hashing, and MySQL integration.
- `server.js` is configured with CORS, error handling, and user route registration.
- Environment variables in `.env` manage database credentials securely.
- Documentation portal is live at [https://mymoolah-africa.github.io/mymoolah-platform/](https://mymoolah-africa.github.io/mymoolah-platform/).
- OpenAPI spec (`openapi.yaml`) is included for API reference and can be viewed in Swagger Editor or Redoc.
- **Note:** The documentation site is static and separate from the backend API, which runs locally or in Codespaces.

---

## Configuration & Environment Files

- `.env`: Stores environment variables for database credentials and other secrets.
- `config/db.js`: Sets up the MySQL connection pool using environment variables.
- `server.js`: Main entry point for the backend server, configures middleware, routes, and error handling.
- `routes/users.js`: Handles user registration and related API endpoints.

## Git Workflow: Moving Folders/Files from Local Development to GitHub

**Best Practice:**
- Always copy your new or updated files/folders into your local clone of the GitHub repo (not directly into the remote via the web interface).
- Use git to track, commit, and push your changes. This ensures version control, collaboration, and triggers any automations (like documentation deployment).

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Copy your files/folders into your local repo directory.**
   - Example: Drag and drop, or use the `cp` command in your terminal.

2. **Check the status of your repo:**
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   - This shows new, modified, or deleted files/folders.

3. **Stage your changes:**
   - To add everything (recommended):
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
   - To add a specific folder:
     ```bash
     git add path/to/your-folder
     ```
   - To add a specific file:
     ```bash
     git add path/to/your-file
     ```

4. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add/update files and folders from local development"
   ```

5. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

6. **Check your repo on GitHub** to confirm the changes are there.

**Notes:**
- Git will track all files inside folders you add, except those listed in `.gitignore`.
- If you delete a folder locally and run `git add .`, Git will stage the deletion as well.
- Use `git status` to review what will be added, modified, or deleted before you commit.
