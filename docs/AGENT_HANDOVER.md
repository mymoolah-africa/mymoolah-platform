# MyMoolah Treasury Platform - Agent Handover Documentation

---

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL: NEW AGENTS MUST READ RULES FIRST** ⚠️

**BEFORE DOING ANY WORK, YOU MUST:**

1. **Read `docs/CURSOR_2.0_RULES_FINAL.md`** using `read_file` tool
2. **Provide proof of reading** (summarize 3-5 key rules, mention specific details)
3. **State explicitly**: "✅ Rules reading completed - I have read `docs/CURSOR_2.0_RULES_FINAL.md` and will follow all rules"
4. **NO WORK UNTIL CONFIRMED** - You cannot proceed with any work until rules reading is confirmed with evidence

**This is MANDATORY per Rule 2. Failure to do this will result in incorrect work.**

---

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL: ALL TESTING MUST BE IN CODESPACES** ⚠️

**MANDATORY TESTING REQUIREMENT:**

- ❌ **DO NOT** test on local machine
- ❌ **DO NOT** test in other environments  
- ✅ **ALWAYS** test in Codespaces (CS)
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use Codespaces as primary testing environment

**Reason**: Codespaces has correct environment configuration, database connections, and credentials matching production-like conditions.

**Documentation**: See `docs/CODESPACES_TESTING_REQUIREMENT.md` for:
- Complete Codespaces .env configuration
- Testing workflow and commands
- Zapper credentials status
- Verification checklist

**Current Codespaces .env**: Contains all required credentials including Zapper UAT credentials. See `docs/CODESPACES_TESTING_REQUIREMENT.md` for full configuration.

**Last Updated**: December 19, 2025  
**Version**: 2.4.25 - Auto-Learning Knowledge Base & Support Service Improvements  
**Status**: ✅ **AUTO-LEARNING IMPLEMENTED** ✅ **SUPPORT SERVICE OPTIMIZED** ✅ **GPT-5 MODEL CONFIG CENTRALIZED**

---

## Update 2025-12-19 (Evening) - Auto-Learning Knowledge Base Implementation
- **Auto-Learning Feature**: Implemented automatic storage of successful OpenAI answers into `AiKnowledgeBase` database table
- **Flow**: When a question isn't found in KB/patterns → OpenAI generates answer → If answer is valid (not error/fallback) → Automatically stored in `ai_knowledge_base` table
- **Benefits**: Subsequent identical questions are answered from database (no OpenAI call, faster, cheaper, consistent)
- **Smart Storage**: 
  - Extracts keywords from questions automatically
  - Infers category from query type
  - Checks for duplicates (updates existing entries if answer is improved)
  - Invalidates cache immediately so new entries are found on next query
- **Implementation**: Added `storeAiAnswerInKnowledgeBase()` and `extractKeywords()` methods to `bankingGradeSupportService.js`
- **Wired Into**: Auto-learning triggers after successful AI answers in `getTechnicalSupport` (and any other `requiresAI: true` queries)
- **Status**: ✅ Auto-learning implemented and wired, ✅ Knowledge base grows automatically, ✅ Ready for testing

## Update 2025-12-19 - Unified Support Service & GPT-5 Model Configuration
- **Unified Support Entry Point**: All support traffic (`/api/v1/support/chat`, `/support/health`, `/support/metrics`) now flows through `services/supportService.js`, which orchestrates:
  - `services/bankingGradeSupportService.js` → banking-grade layer (rate limiting, Redis caching, health, metrics, knowledge base `AiKnowledgeBase`, ISO20022/Mojaloop envelope).
  - `services/aiSupportService.js` → AI/pattern engine (direct pattern matching, simple query handlers, GPT-backed complex answers, codebase sweep integration).
- **Architecture**: `SupportService` enforces rate limiting via banking layer, checks the knowledge base first, then delegates to AI/pattern engine when no KB hit exists, and wraps all responses in a canonical banking-grade envelope consumed by the wallet UI.
- **Model Configuration**: Introduced `SUPPORT_AI_MODEL` env var used by the unified stack; all support-related OpenAI calls now default to `gpt-5` but can be switched centrally (e.g. to `gpt-5.1`/`gpt-5.2`) without code changes.
- **Docs Updated**: `docs/BANKING_GRADE_SUPPORT_SYSTEM.md` and `docs/AI_SUPPORT_SYSTEM.md` now describe the unified architecture and env-based model selection. Session log created: `docs/session_logs/2025-12-19_2300_support-service-consolidation.md`.
- **Status**: ✅ Support stack unified and documented, ✅ Model selection centralized, ✅ No breaking changes to existing `/api/v1/support/chat` consumers.

## Update 2025-12-16 - Critical Fixes: Airtime/Data Purchase ENUM Constraints & Variable Scope
- **ENUM Constraints Fixed**: Converted `vas_products.supplierId` and `vas_transactions.supplierId` from ENUM to VARCHAR(50) to allow "FLASH" and other supplier codes
- **Variable Scope Issues Fixed**: Fixed `vasProductIdForTransaction` and `productAmountInCents` scope errors by declaring variables outside try/catch and if/else blocks
- **ProductVariant Type Extraction**: Fixed to get type from `Product.type` instead of non-existent `ProductVariant.vasType`
- **VasProduct Creation**: Implemented on-the-fly VasProduct creation when ProductVariant doesn't have matching VasProduct
- **Error Handling Improved**: Error responses now show actual error messages in development/staging mode for better debugging
- **Purchase Flow Working**: R10 Vodacom airtime purchase tested successfully - transaction recorded correctly
- **Bill Payments & Electricity**: Both use `vas_transactions` table, so they're already covered by the ENUM fix
- **Migrations**: `20250116_fix_vas_products_supplier_id_enum.js` and `20250116_fix_vas_transactions_supplier_id_enum.js` created
- **Manual SQL**: Manual SQL script created and executed for `vas_transactions.supplierId` (migration not detected by Sequelize)
- **Status**: ✅ Airtime/data purchase flow working, ✅ All ENUM constraints fixed, ✅ Ready for bill payment and electricity testing

## Update 2025-12-13 - Extended Session (Beneficiary system audit + Airtime/Data UX design)
- **Beneficiary System Audit**: Comprehensive review completed - unified model confirmed working correctly
- **Beneficiary Structure**: One person can have multiple service accounts (airtime/data numbers, bank accounts, electricity meters)
- **Service Filtering**: Works correctly with `vasServices.airtime[]`, `vasServices.data[]`, `paymentMethods.bankAccounts[]`, `utilityServices.electricity[]`
- **API Endpoints Ready**: `/by-service/airtime-data`, `POST /`, `POST /:id/services` all functional
- **Airtime/Data UX Design**: Complete beneficiary-first UX specification created in `docs/AIRTIME_DATA_UX_UPGRADE.md` (212 lines)
- **Design Principles**: Beneficiary selection → Account selection → Product selection → Confirmation (user-centric flow)
- **Components Created**: Modern React components built (`RecentRecipients`, `NetworkFilter`, `SmartProductGrid`, `SmartSuggestions`) but NOT integrated
- **Status**: Original `AirtimeDataOverlay` restored, modern components exist as reference in `mymoolah-wallet-frontend/components/overlays/airtime-data/`
- **Next Steps**: Rebuild airtime/data overlay using beneficiary-first flow per `docs/AIRTIME_DATA_UX_UPGRADE.md` specification

---

## Update 2025-12-13 (Voucher deduplication complete - Hollywood Bets 9→1 card)
- Voucher deduplication now working correctly: Hollywood Bets (9 denominations) consolidated to 1 best deal card.
- Normalization: Strip denomination suffixes (" R10", " R100", " Voucher", " Gift Card") from product names before grouping.
- Service type detection: Use `vasType` parameter from API call (`/api/v1/suppliers/compare/voucher`) to identify voucher comparisons.
- Grouping key: All variants (e.g., "Hollywood Bets R10", "Hollywood Bets R100") group under `voucher:hollywood bets`.
- Best deal selection: (1) highest commission → (2) lowest user price → (3) preferred supplier (Flash) on ties.
- File: `services/supplierComparisonService.js` - Added normalization regex, `serviceType` parameter routing.
- Impact: Voucher overlay now shows 1 card per logical product instead of multiple cards for every denomination.
- Status: ✅ Deduplication working, ✅ Tested with Hollywood Bets, ✅ Ready for all multi-denomination vouchers.

## Update 2025-12-11 (SBSA T-PPP submission & phase-1 integration scope)
- Standard Bank (SBSA) submitted our T-PPP registration to PASA; sponsor bank confirmed receipt.
- Integration meeting with SBSA scheduled next Wednesday to receive API details.
- Phase 1 scope (no code changes yet; documentation only):
  1) Incoming deposit notification API from SBSA → validate reference as wallet/float; if valid, credit wallet/float with correct transaction description; if invalid, return error description.
  2) Enable PayShap API service for outbound payments (wallet/float → external bank) and Request Money (inbound from external bank).
- Fees & VAT: SBSA PayShap fees plus MyMoolah markup; VAT handled via the existing unified VAT/commission service already used for Zapper, vouchers (Flash/MobileMart), and VAS.

## Update 2025-12-11 (Supplier comparison includes vouchers)
- Supplier comparison now includes voucher vasType and dynamically groups all suppliers (Flash, MobileMart, future) via the normalized ProductVariant schema.
- Selection priority is unified: highest MMTP commission → lowest user price → preferred supplier (Flash) on ties.
- Product-level comparison (best-variant) uses the same tie-breakers for consistency.

## Update 2025-12-10 (voucher commissions, ledger, startup)
- Product-level commission support added for vouchers: commission lookup now prioritizes productId (fallback to serviceType with voucher/digital_voucher alias). Migration `20251210_add_product_id_to_supplier_commission_tiers.js` adds productId to the tiers table.
- Flash voucher product commission rates (VAT-inclusive) seeded and cleaned; current rates per productId: 10:5.000, 11:2.500, 12:3.100, 27:3.500, 28:3.500, 29:3.500, 30:3.000, 31:6.000, 32:4.500, 33:3.100, 34:4.500, 35:2.800, 36:2.800, 39:6.000, 40:7.000, 41:3.500, 42:3.500, 43:4.800, 44:4.500.
- VAT + commission ledger confirmed for vouchers (Flash) in UAT (e.g., VOUCHER_1765401166585_0x2sgm posts VAT and journal). Ledger accounts created in DB for env codes.
- Startup log ordering fixed: “🎉 All background services started successfully” now prints after services start/server listen. Ledger readiness check remains (warn in dev, fail in prod if missing).
- Outstanding: adjust specific product rates if business requests; seed non-Flash suppliers similarly if needed.

### NEW: SFTP Gateway for MobileMart (2025-12-08) ✅ infrastructure in place
- Provisioned SFTP Gateway Standard VM `sftp-1-vm` (africa-south1-a) using instance service account `sftp-gateway` with full API access.
- GCS bucket `mymoolah-sftp-inbound` (africa-south1, private, uniform, versioning on) connected via “Use instance’s service account”; read/write verified.
- Folder/prefix created for `mobilemart` (home directory). User `mobilemart` to be finalized once their SSH public key is received.
- Firewall: SSH 22 and HTTPS 443 restricted to admin IP and tag `sftp-1-deployment`; update allowlist with MobileMart IP/CIDR when provided.
- Connection details (after key install): host 34.35.168.101, port 22, username `mobilemart`, key auth only. Self-signed cert expected on UI (https).
- TODO: Add MobileMart public key, add their IP/CIDR to firewall, create/enable SFTP user, and (optional) add GCS event trigger for recon ingestion.

### NEW: Airtime/Data Beneficiary Cleanup (2025-12-08) ✅ frontend filtering
- Change: Frontend now skips creating fallback accounts for airtime/data when no active services exist, preventing removed beneficiaries from reappearing as stale entries.
- File: `mymoolah-wallet-frontend/services/beneficiaryService.ts`
- Tests: Manual UI in Codespaces (add → remove beneficiary; list clears).
- Restart: Not required (frontend-only).

### NEW: Airtime/Data Backend Payload Cleanup (2025-12-08) ✅ backend filtering
- Change: Backend `getBeneficiariesByService` now suppresses legacy airtime/data rows that only have `accountType` with no active airtime/data services (JSONB or normalized tables), reducing payload noise.
- File: `services/UnifiedBeneficiaryService.js`
- Tests: Manual UI verification (add → remove; list clears; payload no longer includes legacy-only airtime/data rows).
- Restart: Required for backend change (npm start / pm2 restart if running).

### NEW: Request Money Recent Payer Hide (2025-12-08) ✅ frontend persistence
- Change: Request Money “Recent payers” removal now persists across navigation/reload via per-user hidden list stored in localStorage.
- File: `mymoolah-wallet-frontend/pages/RequestMoneyPage.tsx`
- Tests: Manual UI in Codespaces (remove payer → leave page → return, payer remains hidden).
- Restart: Not required (frontend-only).

### NEW: Request Money Recent Payer Hide (Backend) (2025-12-08) ✅ server-side
- Change: Added `RecentPayerHides` table and endpoints to hide/unhide recent payers; `listRecentPayers` now excludes hidden payers server-side. Frontend now calls hide endpoint (no localStorage).
- Files: `migrations/20251208_06_create_recent_payer_hides.js`, `models/RecentPayerHide.js`, `controllers/requestController.js`, `routes/requests.js`, `mymoolah-wallet-frontend/pages/RequestMoneyPage.tsx`
- Tests: Manual (remove payer, reload page, payer stays hidden). No automated tests added.
- Restart: Backend restart required after running migration; frontend change requires rebuild/reload only.

### NEW: Send Money Beneficiary Removal (2025-12-08) ✅ backend + frontend
- Change: Send Money removal now calls backend removal in payment context; backend inactivates payment methods and clears JSONB fallbacks so removed payment beneficiaries do not reappear.
- Files: `mymoolah-wallet-frontend/pages/SendMoneyPage.tsx`, `services/UnifiedBeneficiaryService.js`
- Tests: Manual (remove payment beneficiary, navigate away/back, beneficiary stays removed).
- Restart: Backend restart required after deploy.
- Fix: Removal call no longer coerces beneficiary id to Number(), preventing `NaN` payloads when ids are strings.
- Guard: Skip backend removal for non-numeric ids (local-only temp beneficiaries) while still removing locally.
- Filter: Payment beneficiaries now require active payment methods; removed legacy fallback that included payment beneficiaries solely by accountType/msisdn, so deleted payment beneficiaries stay hidden on reload.
- Filter tightened: No accountType fallback for payment; list only shows beneficiaries with active payment methods.
- Deactivation: Removal now deactivates all payment methods for the beneficiary (not just mymoolah/bank), so reload will not resurface removed payment beneficiaries.
- ID mapping: Payment beneficiary ids now use backend ids (no `b-` prefix) so backend removals proceed correctly.

### NEW: Voucher Purchase Fixes (2025-12-08) ✅ backend + frontend
- Fixed missing DB columns blocking voucher purchase (`supplierProductId`, `denominations`, `constraints`, `serviceType`, `operation`); migrations are idempotent and applied via master script.
- Relaxed denomination validation to allow products with empty denominations; FLASH mock now always returns voucherCode/reference.
- API response now surfaces `voucherCode` and `transactionRef`; frontend unwraps response, strips prefix, and wraps text for clean display.
- Tests: Manual voucher purchase (Spotify) in Codespaces; success modal shows code/ref. Wallet transaction history not yet created for vouchers (pending).
- Restart: Backend restart required after migrations (done).

### NEW: Voucher ledger + history + secure PIN handling (2025-12-09) ✅
- Voucher purchases now: debit wallet, create Transaction history entry (type `payment`) with masked voucher metadata, and attach walletTransactionId to order metadata.
- Commission VAT recorded in `tax_transactions` and ledger posted (when env accounts set): debit MM commission clearing; credit VAT control; credit commission revenue.
- Voucher codes no longer stored in cleartext: masked in metadata; encrypted envelope (AES-256-GCM, 24h TTL) stored when `VOUCHER_CODE_KEY`/`VOUCHER_PIN_KEY` configured; safe supplierResponse stored without raw code.
- Frontend: success modal gets copy-to-clipboard button; transaction history page shows masked voucher code in list drilldown.
- Tests: `node --test tests/productPurchaseService.voucher.dev.test.js` (uses stub DATABASE_URL).

### **🚀 LAUNCH STRATEGY: PINLESS PRODUCTS & STRICT BENEFICIARY FILTERING - COMPLETE (2025-12-04)** ✅
- **Launch Strategy Implementation**: Implemented product filtering and beneficiary filtering for launch
- **Product Sync Filtering**: Updated MobileMart product sync to filter products based on launch requirements:
  - **Airtime/Data**: Only sync PINLESS products (`pinned === false`) for direct topup to beneficiary's mobile number
  - **Electricity**: Only sync PINNED products (`pinned === true`) for voucher/PIN redemption
  - Filtering applied during sync - pinned products for airtime/data are skipped (logged)
- **Strict Beneficiary Filtering**: Removed MyMoolah wallet fallback from airtime/data beneficiary filtering:
  - Only beneficiaries with explicit airtime/data service accounts are shown in airtime/data overlay
  - Prevents "Send Money" beneficiaries from appearing in airtime/data list
  - Clear separation between payment beneficiaries and service beneficiaries (banking-grade best practice)
- **Product Catalog Queries**: Verified already filtering by `transactionType: 'topup'` (pinless) - correct
- **Beneficiary Architecture Confirmed**: One beneficiary can have multiple services (airtime, data, electricity meters) with descriptions
- **Files Modified**:
  - `scripts/sync-mobilemart-to-product-variants.js` - Added pinless/pinned filtering with logging
  - `services/UnifiedBeneficiaryService.js` - Removed MyMoolah wallet fallback (lines 1124-1143)
- **Rationale**: Banking-grade best practice - explicit service accounts only, clear separation of concerns
- **Status**: ✅ Ready for launch testing
- **Next Steps**: Test product sync, verify beneficiary filtering in staging/UAT

### **🗄️ SCHEMA SYNCHRONIZATION & CONNECTION STANDARDIZATION - COMPLETE (2025-12-03)** ✅
- **Schema Parity Achieved**: UAT and Staging now have identical schemas (106 tables, 530 columns)
- **Missing Tables Synced**: Created 6 missing tables in UAT:
  - `sync_audit_logs` (via migration `20251203_01_create_sync_audit_logs_table`)
  - `compliance_records`, `mobilemart_transactions`, `reseller_floats`, `tax_configurations`, `flash_commission_tiers` (via schema sync)
- **Enum Types Created**: 18 enum types created in UAT required for missing tables
- **Standardized Connection System**: Created comprehensive connection infrastructure:
  - `scripts/db-connection-helper.js` - Centralized connection manager (UAT from .env, Staging from Secret Manager)
  - `scripts/run-migrations-master.sh` - Master migration script (single command: `./scripts/run-migrations-master.sh [uat|staging]`)
  - `scripts/audit-extra-staging-tables.js` - Table audit tool
  - `scripts/check-migration-status.js` - Migration status checker
  - `scripts/sync-missing-tables-from-staging-to-uat.js` - Reverse schema sync

- **No Functional Changes**: All changes are whitespace/formatting only, no behavior modifications
- **Status**: ✅ Formatting improvements complete, ready for commit

### **💸 Transaction Fee Label Standardization & Performance Tooling - COMPLETE (2025-11-18)** ✅
- **Unified Fee Copy**: All customer-facing surfaces (wallet modal, ledger entries, docs, QA guides) now use the neutral label **“Transaction Fee.”** No more “Zapper Transaction Fee” wording in UI, API responses, or documentation.
- **Transaction History Alignment**: `controllers/walletController.js` filter comments and docs updated so the only fee line users see is “Transaction Fee,” matching the new copy.
- **Automation Tooling**: Added `scripts/perf-test-api-latencies.js` to log in, call core endpoints, and highlight any average latency ≥200 ms (outputs avg/p95/min/max per route).
- **Performance Findings**: Supplier comparison and `/settings` endpoints still spike above 250–400 ms; recommend caching comparison results (60 s Redis) and trimming settings payload.
- **Backup**: Created `backups/mymoolah-backup-2025-11-18_1500.tar.gz` (full repo, archive excludes itself).
- **Next Actions**:
  1. Run the latency sampler after backend changes (`node scripts/perf-test-api-latencies.js` with valid wallet creds).
  2. Prioritize caching/indexing work for `/suppliers/trending`, `/suppliers/compare/*`, `/settings`, and voucher-heavy endpoints called out by the script.
  3. Consider extracting a `TRANSACTION_FEE_LABEL` constant so future work can’t drift back to provider-specific wording.

### **🆔 PREVIOUS SESSION: KYC DRIVER'S LICENSE VALIDATION - COMPLETE** ✅
Previous session implemented comprehensive validation for South African driver's licenses in the KYC system. The implementation handles the unique format of SA driver's licenses, including ID number format with prefix ("02/6411055084084"), name format in CAPS with initials ("A BOTES"), and date range format for validity periods ("dd/mm/yyyy - dd/mm/yyyy"). Additionally, improved OpenAI content policy refusal detection to automatically trigger Tesseract OCR fallback.

### **📋 KYC DRIVER'S LICENSE VALIDATION - COMPLETE** ✅
- **ID Number Format**: Handles "02/6411055084084" format (extracts "6411055084084") and standard license format "AB123456CD"
- **Name Format**: Handles CAPS format "INITIALS SURNAME" (e.g., "A BOTES") - extracts surname from last part
- **Date Format**: Handles "dd/mm/yyyy - dd/mm/yyyy" format - extracts second date as expiry, only validates expiry
- **Validation Logic**: Only checks if license is expired (not between dates), accepts both ID number and license number formats
- **OpenAI Fallback**: Improved refusal detection to trigger Tesseract OCR automatically when OpenAI refuses
- **Status**: ✅ Implementation complete, ⏳ Ready for testing with actual driver's license

#### **Driver's License Format Details**
- **ID Number**: May appear as "02/6411055084084" (two digits + "/" + 13-digit ID) OR "AB123456CD" (license format)
- **Name**: Usually "INITIALS SURNAME" in CAPS (e.g., "A BOTES" where "A" is initial and "BOTES" is surname)
- **Valid Dates**: Format "dd/mm/yyyy - dd/mm/yyyy" (e.g., "15/01/2020 - 15/01/2030")
- **Validation**: Only the second date (expiry) is validated - license must not be expired

#### **OpenAI Refusal Handling**
- **Early Detection**: Now checks for refusals BEFORE attempting JSON parsing
- **Pattern Matching**: Detects "I'm sorry", "can't extract", "can't assist", "unable" messages
- **Automatic Fallback**: Triggers Tesseract OCR automatically when OpenAI refuses
- **Status**: ✅ Improved detection and fallback mechanism

#### **Files Modified**
- `services/kycService.js`: ID number parsing, date normalization, name parsing, validation logic, OpenAI prompt, refusal detection

#### **Next Steps**
- ⏳ Test with actual SA driver's license to verify all format handling
- ⏳ Verify Tesseract OCR fallback works when OpenAI refuses
- ⏳ Remove temporary testing exception for user ID 1 once validation confirmed
