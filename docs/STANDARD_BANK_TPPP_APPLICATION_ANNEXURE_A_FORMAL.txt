ANNEXURE A: OVERVIEW OF NATURE OF BUSINESS / BUSINESS MODEL

MyMoolah Treasury Platform: A Mojaloop-Aligned Financial Services Ecosystem


1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

MyMoolah operates a sophisticated Treasury Platform as a Service (TPaaS) that serves as the foundation for a comprehensive suite of digital financial services. Our mission is to foster financial inclusion by providing secure, accessible, and efficient payment solutions to unbanked and underbanked populations across Africa. By leveraging a robust, banking-grade architecture and adhering to Mojaloop principles, MyMoolah bridges the gap between traditional banking infrastructure and modern digital commerce, enabling seamless value exchange for individuals and small businesses.

Our business model is centered on a digital wallet ecosystem that integrates a wide array of Value-Added Services (VAS), including airtime, data, bill payments, and digital vouchers. As a Third-Party Payment Provider (TPPP), our goal is to extend the reach of formal financial services, drive economic empowerment, and create a more inclusive financial landscape.


2. BUSINESS MODEL

The MyMoolah business model is architected around three core pillars: a centralized Treasury Platform, a user-facing Digital Wallet, and an extensive network of integrated Value-Added Services.


2.1 Treasury Platform as a Service (TPaaS)

Our banking-grade Treasury Platform is the cornerstone of our operations, providing a secure, scalable, and compliant infrastructure for managing financial transactions. Key capabilities include:

- Double-Entry Ledger System: Ensures full auditability and financial integrity for all transactions.
- Float and Settlement Management: Automated management of float accounts and settlement with service providers.
- Multi-Supplier Integration: A unified API layer for seamless integration with multiple VAS providers and financial institutions.
- Mojaloop-Aligned Architecture: Designed for interoperability and real-time clearing, in alignment with Mojaloop principles.


2.2 Digital Wallet Ecosystem

The MyMoolah digital wallet is the primary interface for our users, offering a secure and user-friendly platform for managing funds and accessing services. The wallet supports:

- Secure Value Storage: Encrypted and secure storage of user funds.
- Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Transfers: Instantaneous and low-cost money transfers between MyMoolah users.
- QR Code Payments: Zapper integration for seamless merchant payments.
- Bill Payments and VAS Purchases: A comprehensive marketplace for essential digital services.


2.3 Value-Added Services (VAS) Marketplace

Our platform integrates with leading service providers to offer a wide range of VAS, creating a one-stop-shop for our users' daily transactional needs. Key integrations include:

- Airtime and Data: Flash and MobileMart for all major mobile networks.
- Digital Vouchers: EasyPay and other providers for retail, gaming, and entertainment.
- Bill Payments: Utility and other bill payments through integrated partners.
- Real-Time Payments: PayShap integration via DT Mercury and Peach Payments for real-time bank transfers.


3. TARGET MARKET

Our primary target market comprises two key segments:

- Unbanked and Underbanked Consumers: Individuals who lack access to traditional banking services but have mobile phones. MyMoolah provides them with a secure and accessible entry point into the digital economy.

- Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs): Informal merchants and small businesses that require low-cost, efficient payment acceptance and disbursement solutions. Our platform enables them to participate in digital commerce and grow their businesses.


4. REVENUE STREAMS

MyMoolah generates revenue through a diversified set of streams, ensuring a sustainable and scalable business model:

- Commissions on VAS Sales: A percentage-based commission on all airtime, data, voucher, and other VAS products sold through the platform.

- Transaction Fees: Nominal fees on specific transaction types, such as bill payments and real-time transfers, designed to be significantly lower than traditional banking fees.

- Merchant Services: Fees for payment processing and other value-added services offered to our SME clients.


5. TECHNOLOGY AND SECURITY

Our platform is built on a modern, secure, and scalable technology stack designed to meet the rigorous standards of the financial services industry.

- Technology: Node.js backend with a PostgreSQL database, architected for high availability and low latency.

- Security: Banking-grade security measures, including TLS 1.3, end-to-end encryption, JWT-based authentication, and comprehensive rate limiting.

- Compliance: Adherence to Mojaloop principles for interoperability and real-time clearing, with a commitment to meeting all regulatory requirements for TPPPs.


6. CONCLUSION

MyMoolah's business model is strategically designed to address a critical gap in the financial services market. By combining a robust, banking-grade Treasury Platform with a user-friendly digital wallet and a comprehensive VAS marketplace, we are creating a powerful ecosystem for financial inclusion. Our alignment with Mojaloop principles and our unwavering commitment to security and compliance position us as a trusted partner for financial institutions and a vital enabler of economic empowerment for our users.
