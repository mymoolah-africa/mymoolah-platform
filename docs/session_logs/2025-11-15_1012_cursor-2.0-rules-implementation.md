# Session Log - 2025-11-15 - Cursor 2.0 Rules Implementation

**Session Date**: 2025-11-15 10:12  
**Agent**: Cursor AI Agent  
**User**: André  
**Session Duration**: ~1 hour

---

## Session Summary
This session focused on implementing and refining the Cursor 2.0 agent rules system. We created comprehensive rules documentation, clarified the git workflow (check status before pull, commit locally, user pushes), and implemented a mandatory rules confirmation requirement that requires agents to provide proof they've actually read the rules file before starting work.

---

## Tasks Completed
- [x] Created CURSOR_2.0_RULES_FINAL.md with comprehensive agent rules
- [x] Clarified git workflow: Local → Commit → Push → Pull in Codespaces
- [x] Added safe pull procedure: Always check git status before pulling
- [x] Implemented mandatory rules confirmation requirement
- [x] Enhanced confirmation to require proof of reading (not just claim)
- [x] Committed all Cursor 2.0 rules files and session logging system
- [x] Pushed all changes to GitHub (4 commits)

---

## Key Decisions
- **Decision 1: Git Workflow Clarification**: Confirmed that the workflow is Local → Commit → Push → Pull. Agents must check git status before pulling to avoid conflicts with uncommitted changes. User pushes to GitHub, then pulls in Codespaces.
- **Decision 2: Mandatory Rules Confirmation**: Implemented requirement that agents must use `read_file` tool to actually read the rules file and provide evidence (summarize key rules, mention specific details) before starting any work. This ensures agents don't just claim to have read rules but actually do.
- **Decision 3: Proof of Reading**: Changed from simple confirmation to requiring proof - agents must summarize 3-5 key rules and mention specific details to demonstrate they actually read and understood the rules file.

## Files Modified
- `docs/CURSOR_2.0_RULES_FINAL.md` - Created comprehensive rules file with all 10 rules, git workflow clarification, mandatory confirmation requirement
- `docs/CURSOR_2.0_AGENT_RULES.md` - Created (initial version)
- `docs/CURSOR_2.0_RULES_CONCISE.md` - Created (initial version)
- `docs/SESSION_LOGGING_PROCESS.md` - Created session logging documentation
- `docs/session_logs/TEMPLATE.md` - Created session log template
- `docs/session_logs/README.md` - Created session logs documentation
- `docs/session_logs/EXAMPLE.md` - Created example session log
- `scripts/create-session-log.sh` - Created session log creation script

---

## Code Changes Summary
- **Rules Documentation**: Created comprehensive Cursor 2.0 rules system with 10 rules covering git workflow, session continuity, working directory constraints, definition of done, security, documentation, testing, error handling, performance, and communication
- **Git Workflow**: Clarified and confirmed workflow: Local work → Commit locally → Push to GitHub (user) → Pull in Codespaces
- **Safe Pull Procedure**: Added requirement to check git status before pulling, with options to commit or stash uncommitted changes
- **Rules Confirmation**: Implemented mandatory confirmation that requires agents to actually read rules file and provide proof of understanding

---

## Issues Encountered
- **Issue 1**: Initial git workflow rule said "always pull first" which could cause conflicts with uncommitted changes. **Resolution**: Updated to require checking git status first, then commit/stash if needed before pulling.
- **Issue 2**: Initial rules confirmation was just a claim without proof. **Resolution**: Enhanced to require actual file reading with `read_file` tool and evidence (summaries, specific details) to prove understanding.

---

## Testing Performed
- [x] Manual testing performed
- [x] Git workflow tested: Checked status, committed changes, pushed to GitHub
- [x] Rules file structure verified
- [x] Session log template created and tested
- [x] Test results: All successful - 4 commits pushed to GitHub

---

## Next Steps
- [ ] **User Action**: Test the new rules by restarting Cursor and verifying new agent reads rules and provides confirmation
- [ ] **Next Agent**: Should follow Rule 2 and provide mandatory rules confirmation with proof of reading
- [ ] **Verification**: User should verify that new agent uses `read_file` tool and provides evidence of understanding

---

## Important Context for Next Agent
- **CRITICAL**: You MUST read `docs/CURSOR_2.0_RULES_FINAL.md` using `read_file` tool and provide proof you read it (summarize 3-5 key rules, mention specific details) before starting ANY work
- **Git Workflow**: Always check `git status` before pulling. Workflow is: Local → Commit → Push (user) → Pull in Codespaces
- **Session Logging**: This session log system is now in place - you must create session logs when work is complete (not waiting for session end)
- **Rules System**: Comprehensive Cursor 2.0 rules are now in place - follow all 10 rules strictly
- **User Preference**: User prefers to push to git themselves - AI agent commits but does NOT push (unless explicitly asked)
