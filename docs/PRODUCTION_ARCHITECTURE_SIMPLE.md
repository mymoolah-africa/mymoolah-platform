# MyMoolah Production Architecture - Simple Explanation

## 🎯 **WHAT WILL THE FINAL PRODUCT LOOK LIKE?**

Think of it like a **secure bank building** with different entrances:

---

## 🏢 **THE BUILDING (Google Cloud Platform)**

Your entire platform will run on **Google Cloud** - like renting space in a secure, high-tech building.

### **Parts of the Building:**

1. **Main App (Customer Wallet)** - The public-facing website
2. **Admin Portal** - Your team's control center
3. **Backend API** - The "brain" that powers everything
4. **Database** - Where all data is stored securely

---

## 🌐 **THE ADDRESSES (URLs)**

### **Main Website:**
- **Public URL**: `https://www.mymoolah.africa`
  - This is what customers visit
  - Data-free access (no mobile data charges)
  - Secure (HTTPS with banking-grade security)

### **Customer Wallet App:**
- **URL**: `https://app.mymoolah.africa` or `https://wallet.mymoolah.africa`
  - Where customers log in and use their wallets
  - Mobile-friendly web app
  - Data-free for customers

### **Admin Portal:**
- **URL**: `https://admin.mymoolah.africa`
  - Only your team can access
  - Password protected + extra security
  - Manage users, transactions, reports

### **API (Backend):**
- **URL**: `https://api.mymoolah.africa`
  - Powers the frontend apps
  - Not directly accessible to users
  - Very secure, only allows authorized requests

---

## 🔒 **SECURITY LAYERS (Like Bank Security)**

### **Layer 1: TLS 1.3 Encryption**
- All communication is encrypted (like a secure phone line)
- Banking-grade encryption
- No one can intercept data

### **Layer 2: Firewall & Access Control**
- Only authorized traffic allowed
- Blocks malicious requests
- Rate limiting (prevents attacks)

### **Layer 3: Database Security**
- Encrypted storage
- Only the app can access it
- Regular backups
- Complies with banking regulations

### **Layer 4: Authentication**
- Users must log in securely
- Multi-factor authentication available
- Sessions expire for security

---

## 📱 **DATA-FREE ACCESS**

### **How It Works:**
1. You partner with a **data-free service provider** (like Cell C, MTN, Vodacom)
2. They whitelist your URLs: `*.mymoolah.africa`
3. When customers visit your site on mobile, **no data charges apply**
4. Provider pays for the data, you pay the provider

### **Benefits:**
- Customers can use your app without mobile data costs
- More customers will use your service
- Better user experience

## 🚀 **HOW IT WORKS (Simple Flow)**

### **When a Customer Visits:**

1. **Customer types**: `www.mymoolah.africa` in their phone
2. **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Converts name to Google Cloud IP address
3. **Load Balancer**: Receives request, checks security
4. **Frontend Server**: Sends the login page
5. **Customer logs in**: Frontend sends to Backend API
6. **Backend API**: Checks database, verifies password
7. **Response**: Customer sees their wallet dashboard

**All happens in less than 1 second!**

## 💰 **COST STRUCTURE**

### **Google Cloud Costs:**
- **Compute (Servers)**: ~$50-200/month (depending on traffic)
- **Database**: ~$30-100/month
- **Storage**: ~$5-20/month
- **Networking**: ~$10-50/month
- **Total**: ~$100-400/month for small to medium traffic

### **Data-Free Provider Costs:**
- Pay per GB of data used
- Usually ~$0.10-0.50 per GB
- Negotiate rates with provider

---

## 📊 **PERFORMANCE & SCALABILITY**

### **Can Handle:**
- **Thousands of users** simultaneously
- **Millions of transactions** per day
- **Fast response times** (< 1 second)
- **99.9% uptime** (almost never down)

### **How We Achieve This:**
- Multiple servers (if one breaks, others work)
- Database optimization (fast queries)
- Caching (stores frequently used data)
- CDN (Content Delivery Network - fast file delivery)

---

## 🔐 **MOJALOOP COMPLIANCE**

### **What is Mojaloop?**
- International standard for financial services
- Ensures interoperability between systems
- Banking-grade security requirements

### **How We Comply:**
- ✅ TLS 1.3 encryption
- ✅ Secure authentication
- ✅ Audit logging (record all actions)
- ✅ Data encryption at rest
- ✅ API security standards
- ✅ Transaction security
