Hi Razeen and team,

Thank you for your response. We have completed our side of the UAT configuration and are ready for Theodore to begin testing. Please find our responses to each point below.

---

1. API Key / SessionToken for Theodore Smith

We will share the SessionToken together with the test data (see point 3 below) via a secure encrypted channel. Please ensure Theodore is ready to receive it. For Production, we will follow the same process with our support engineers when we reach go-live.

---

2. UAT / Staging — Configuration Complete

Staging base URL: Our Staging environment is live and configured. We have verified all 5 test scenarios end-to-end (infoRequest, authorisationRequest, paymentNotification, and idempotency).

Base URL: https://staging.mymoolah.africa/billpayment/v1
Endpoints: /ping, /infoRequest, /authorisationRequest, /paymentNotification

We have confirmed that GET https://staging.mymoolah.africa/billpayment/v1/ping returns {"Ping":"OK"}. EasyPay's UAT system can be configured to route test terminal calls to this URL.

IP whitelisting: We have whitelisted your public IP 20.164.206.68 on our Google Cloud Load Balancer (Cloud Armor policy) for the Staging backend. Test traffic from your switch will be accepted.

Credentials: The SessionToken will be shared with Theodore separately (see point 1 above).

3. Test Data for Theodore Smith

Please share the following with Theodore. These EasyPay numbers are seeded in our Staging database and ready for testing:

Scenario 1 — Valid, unpaid (R100.00 fixed)
  EasyPay Number (formatted): 9 5063 0000 0001 1
  Raw Number: 95063000000011
  Expected: Allow payment (ResponseCode: 0). Second attempt must return ResponseCode: 5 (AlreadyPaid) — tests idempotency

Scenario 2 — Already paid (R200.00)
  EasyPay Number (formatted): 9 5063 0000 0002 9
  Raw Number: 95063000000029
  Expected: Reject immediately (ResponseCode: 5 — AlreadyPaid)

Scenario 3 — Expired bill (R50.00)
  EasyPay Number (formatted): 9 5063 0000 0003 7
  Raw Number: 95063000000037
  Expected: Reject (ResponseCode: 3 — Expired)

Scenario 4 — Open amount (R10–R1000)
  EasyPay Number (formatted): 9 5063 0000 0004 5
  Raw Number: 95063000000045
  Expected: Allow any amount between R10.00 and R1000.00. Outside range → ResponseCode: 2

Scenario 5 — Fixed R300.00 (amount validation)
  EasyPay Number (formatted): 9 5063 0000 0005 2
  Raw Number: 95063000000052
  Expected: Only exactly R300.00 accepted. Any other amount → ResponseCode: 2

Important notes for Theo:
- Amounts in the API are in cents (e.g. R100.00 = 10000)
- EchoData must be returned exactly as received in all responses
- Receiver ID: 5063 (MyMoolah's assigned ID)

4. Malusi Mbulwana-Barnard / Sprint Assignment

We have noted the request for @Malusi Mbulwana-Barnard to bring the setup and testing into sprint and assign our test resource. We are ready to support once Theo is assigned and has the SessionToken.

---

5. Production — Correction and Confirmation

Production base URL (corrected from our earlier email):
  Base URL: https://api-mm.mymoolah.africa/billpayment/v1

(Note: Our production API domain is api-mm.mymoolah.africa, not api.mymoolah.africa, due to DNS provider requirements.)

Production configuration will be completed once UAT sign-off has been achieved, as part of our production handover process.

Production IP whitelisting: We will whitelist 20.164.206.68 on our Production infrastructure when we move to go-live (same IP as UAT).

Go-live sign-off: We understand that test sign-off will require:
- Correct testing outcomes for all scenarios
- SOF files at the end of each test cycle verified
- Handover from your test team to production team
- Implementation scheduled as a change

We are aligned with this process.

6. Reconciliation / SOF Files

UAT: We understand that Theo will email the SOF file to us at the end of each test cycle. We are ready to receive and process these.

Production: We have reviewed the EasyPay Bill Payment Output File Specification (PR-E1-0049 v2.8). Please confirm the SFTP details (host, path, credentials) for daily SOF file delivery in Production. The onboarding team may have furnished credentials — if so, please confirm we have the correct set or provide updated details.

---

7. Cash-In Flow (for reference)

Our implementation follows the flow you described:

1. MyMoolah customer selects "Top-up via EasyPay" in the wallet app
2. App generates a unique 14-digit EasyPay number (Receiver ID 5063)
3. Customer presents the number at any EasyPay cashier and pays cash
4. EasyPay terminal calls our /infoRequest — we validate and return amount
5. EasyPay terminal calls our /authorisationRequest — we confirm acceptance
6. EasyPay terminal calls our /paymentNotification — we credit the customer's wallet immediately
7. We return EchoData as required in all responses

We have implemented Cash-In (Top-Up) only at this stage. Cash-Out and Standalone Voucher are not in scope for this activation.

Next Steps

1. Theodore: Receive SessionToken from us (secure channel) and begin test transactions
2. EasyPay: Confirm UAT system is configured with https://staging.mymoolah.africa/billpayment/v1
3. Theodore: Run test cycles and email SOF files to us at end of each cycle
4. Both: Verify test outcomes and proceed to UAT sign-off
5. Production: We will configure Production URL and IP whitelist upon sign-off; EasyPay to provide SFTP details for Production SOF delivery

Please let us know if you need any clarification or additional information.

Best regards,
André
MyMoolah
