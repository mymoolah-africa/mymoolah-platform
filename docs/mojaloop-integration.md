# Mojaloop Integration for MyMoolah

## Introduction
Mojaloop is an open-source platform designed to enable interoperable, real-time digital payments between banks, fintechs, and mobile money providers. Integrating MyMoolah with Mojaloop is a strategic priority to achieve industry-leading interoperability, regulatory alignment, and financial inclusion.

## Strategic Importance
- **Interoperability:** Connect MyMoolah to other Mojaloop participants for seamless payments.
- **Regulatory Alignment:** Align with central bank and payment network initiatives in Africa.
- **Scalability & Security:** Leverage Mojaloop's robust, secure, and scalable architecture.

## Action Plan

### Short-Term Actions
- Study Mojaloop's official documentation and architecture.
- Map MyMoolah's API/data model to Mojaloop's Open API.
- Identify required Mojaloop components (Central Ledger, ALS, Scheme Adapter, etc.).
- Document all findings and decisions in this file.

### Medium-Term Actions
- Deploy a Mojaloop sandbox/test hub (locally or in the cloud using Docker/Kubernetes).
- Register MyMoolah as a Mojaloop participant (FSP) in the test environment.
- Build and test scheme adapters/connectors to bridge MyMoolah's wallet to Mojaloop APIs.
- Engage with the Mojaloop community for support and best practices.

### Long-Term Actions
- Certify integration with Mojaloop (if required by local regulators).
- Go live with Mojaloop for real-time, interoperable payments.
- Maintain compliance, security, and documentation as Mojaloop evolves.

## Technical Research Notes
